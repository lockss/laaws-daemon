N2  - A lot of notes go here it is a long line. There are differences to take into consideration. Sex refers to biological characteristics such as chromosomes, physiology and anatomy that distinguish females and males. Gender refers to the array of socially constructed roles and relationships, personality traits, attitudes, behaviours and values that society ascribes to the two sexes on a differential basis. In health-related research, both sex differences and differences resulting from gender are implied. The present issue of the Monograph offers an excellent overview of the present knowledge about sex and gender differences in the different domains of respiratory medicine and aims to contribute to a better “sex and gender perspective” on health and healthcare in clinical practice and research.
